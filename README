Xtables-addons
==============

Xtables-addons is the proclaimed successor to patch-o-matic(-ng). It
contains extensions that were not accepted in the main Xtables
package.

Xtables-addons is different from patch-o-matic in that you do not have
to patch or recompile either kernel or Xtables(iptables). But please
see the INSTALL file for the minimum requirements of this package.
