Prerequirements
===============

	* iptables-devel 1.4.1

	* kernel-source >= 2.6.19


Compiling
=========

./configure [options]

--with-kbuild=

	Specifies the path to the kernel build output directory. We
	need it for building the kernel extensions. For example, on
	openSUSE:

		--with-kbuild=/usr/src/linux-obj/x86_64/default

--with-ksource=

	Specifies the path to the kernel source directory. This is
	currently needed for building the userspace extensions because
	we use unsanitized kernel headers, but the option MAY
	DISAPPEAR IN FUTURE.

		--with-ksource=/usr/src/linux

--with-iptables=

	Specifies the path to the directory where we may find
	xtables.h, should it not be within the standard C compiler
	include path, or if you want to override it. The directory
	will be checked for xtables.h and include/xtables.h. (This is
	to support the following specs:)

		--with-iptables=/usr/src/iptables
		--with-iptables=/usr/src/iptables/include
		--with-iptables=/opt/iptables/include

--with-iptdir=

	Specifies the path to where the newly built extensions should
	be installed when `make install` is run. It uses the same
	default as the iptables package, ${libexecdir}/iptables.


Note to distribution packagers
==============================

Except for --with-kbuild, distributions should not have a need to
supply any other flags (besides --prefix=/usr and perhaps
--libdir=/usr/lib64, etc.) to configure when all prerequired packages
are installed. If iptables-devel is installed, necessary headers
should be in /usr/include, so --with-iptables is not needed.
