Xtables-addons
==============

Xtables-addons is a set of extensions that were not accepted in the
Linux kernel and/or main Xtables/iptables package.

It superseded the earlier patch-o-matic(-ng) package in that no
patching and/or recompilation of either the kernel or
Xtables/iptables is required. However, do see the INSTALL file for
the minimum requirements of Xtables-addons.


Included in this package
========================
- xt_ACCOUNT 1.16, libxt_ACCOUNT 1.3


External extensions
===================

The program "xa-download-more" can be used to download more
extensions from 3rd parties into the source tree. The URLs are listed
in the "sources" file. If the "sources" file contains an entry like

	http://foobar.org/xa/

xa-download-more will inspect http://foobar.org/xa/xa-index.txt for
files to download. That file may contain

	foobar.tar.bz2

and xa-download-more will then retrieve and unpack
http://foobar.org/xa/foobar.tar.bz2.

Files that should be contained in the tarball are an mconfig and
Kbuild files to control building the extension, libxt_foobar.c for
the userspace extension and xt_foobar.c for the kernel extension.

	mconfig.foobar
	extensions/Kbuild.foobar
	extensions/Mbuild.foobar
	extensions/libxt_foobar.c
	extensions/libxt_foobar.man
	extensions/xt_foobar.c
	extensions/xt_foobar.h
